","MedicationCode","Coding medication in the Netherlands is done on the basis of the G standard (issued by Z-index), which is filled under the direction of KNMP. 

The coded medication can be expressed as:

* GTIN International Article Number
* ZI-nummer (2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.4.8)
* Trade product code (HPK)
* Prescription code (PRK)
* Generic product code (GPK)
* Anatomic Therapeutic Classification code (ATC)
* Substance Name Code (SNK)
*  Substance Name Code, in combination with Route of Administration (SSK)
*  SNOMED CT code

The GTIN enables identification of the product including its origin with a barcode. The ZI number represents the tradeproduct and the package size. The HPK is the code for the trade product (with the brand name) as used per dose/per time the medication is taken (1 pill, 1 puff, 1ml) The PRK contains als GPK information supplemented with information needed to prescribe the right product. this level is intended to facilitate generic prescription of drugs. The GPK defines the pharmaceutical characteristics of a product: ingredients, strengths, units, pharmaceutical form and route of administration. The Substance Name Code (SNK) is the (active) compound. Further information about the G-Standaard levels see https://www.z-index.nl So called 90.000.000 numbers are used in local IT systems. These numbers shall not be used for external communication. In the this is necessary only the description (not the code) may be included. This is in accordance with national agreements (Nictiz Standard).

The bound ValueSet includes the NullFlavor code 'OTH', which is not allowed for the zib concept 'MedicationCode'. However, FHIR explicitly defines 'a textual description if no code is available', which is equivalent to the zib concept 'Medication', to be placed on `.code.text`. The 'OTH' code is included to allow this.","Depending on the context of use, the code that was actually selected by the user (prescriber, dispenser, etc.) will have the coding.userSelected set to true.  As described in the coding datatype: ""A coding may be marked as a ""userSelected"" if a user selected the particular coded value in a user interface (e.g. the user selects an item in a pick-list). If a user selected coding exists, it is the preferred choice for performing translations etc. Other codes can only be literal translations to alternative code systems, or codes at a lower level of granularity (e.g. a generic code for a vendor-specific primary one).","","","","","","","","",,"required","","http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.121.11.12--20200901000000","",,,,"Medication.code",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Extensions that cannot be ignored even if unrecognized","May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants.
