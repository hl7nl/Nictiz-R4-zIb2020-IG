","NameInformation","This slice represents the person's official name information, including given names, last name and possibly the partner's last name.","This `.name` element represents a Dutch name according to the [zib NameInformation (v1.1, 2020)](https://zibs.nl/wiki/NameInformation-v1.1(2020EN)) (except for the GivenName concept). A Dutch name is represented in FHIR as an ordinary international name, but is augmented using extensions to specify how the last name is built up according to the Dutch rules. See the guidance on `.family` and on `.extension:nameUsage` for more information. Systems that need to work in a Dutch context SHOULD support these extensions as specified here. In addition, systems SHOULD use the core elements according to the FHIR specifications to provide compatibility outside Dutch contexts. It is encouraged to provide a representation of the full name in the `.text` element.

**Note 1**: The zib cannot be represented straightforward in FHIR. Especially note the guidance on `.given` on how to map the FirstNames and Initials concepts, and on `.prefix`/`.suffix` on how to map the Titles concept.

**Note 2**: This element should only contain a person's _official_ names. The GivenName concept is represented in another `.name` element with `.name.use` = _usual_.

","FirstName / Initial","One of a person’s official first names or the initial if the full name is not known.","This element represents the FirstNames and Initials concepts of zib NameInformation, but the FHIR implementation deviates from the zib model. The zib defines these concepts as a list of official first names (as a single string) and a list of initials (as a single string), both optional. They both represent the official name(s) of a person and thus represent the same concept. In FHIR however, each first name is either a complete name or an initial, but not both. In addition, each name may be defined separately.

Therefore, the zib concepts are implemented here in the following way:

* Systems SHOULD use a `.given` element for each official first name that they know of (either as a full name or an initial), in order of appearance (as specified by FHIR).
* Each of these elements:
  * SHOULD be populated with the complete name if it is known, or with the initial if no more information is available.
  * SHALL be augmented with `extension:givenOrInitial` with code _BR_ when it represents a full name or code _IN_ when it represents an initial.

Initials should thus not be communicated for each complete first name that is known, in contrast to what is specified by the zib. Receiving systems can recreate initials from the full names if needed.

If a system _does_ however only have a list of official first names and a separate list of official initials, without knowing the relationship between these two, only the full names SHOULD be communicated, while an additional `.name` instance MAY be used to communicate the initials. It is expected that the second instance just contains the initials and no other information from the zib. Receiving systems MAY ignore the second instance.

**Note 1:** The GivenName concept should not be included here but in a separate `.name` instance where `.use` = _usual_.

**Note 2**: As specified by FHIR, multiple official first names MAY be combined in a single `.given` element (separated by spaces), as long as the `.given` elements can be concatenated to form the full first name representation, and the 'extension:givenOrInitial` is used to mark the element as containing either full names or the initials. This pattern is strongly discouraged as it is hard to determine if the value pertains multiple names or a single combined name containing spaces.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"HumanName.given",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
