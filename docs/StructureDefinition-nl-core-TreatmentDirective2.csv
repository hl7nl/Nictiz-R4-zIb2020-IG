","TreatmentDirective","A record of a healthcare consumerâ€™s  choices, which permits or denies identified recipient(s) or recipient role(s) to perform one or more actions within a given policy context, for specific purposes and periods of time.","A straightforward and accurate mapping of zib TreatmentDirective2 to FHIR is not possible. The main consideration is to choose between the Consent and CarePlan resource. Unfortunately, the Consent resource does not have full support for treatment directives yet as its main focus is to model Patient's privacy consents. Regardless, it seems to be the best match to represent the intention of the zib, as both the resource and the zib cover a mutual agreement about treatments and not per se the resulting actions or policy for treatments, which would better be handled using the CarePlan resource.

","Extensions that cannot be ignored even if unrecognized","May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).","There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","Modifier extensions allow for extensions that *cannot* be safely ignored to be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be safely ignored.  This promotes interoperability by eliminating the need for implementers to prohibit the presence of extensions.
