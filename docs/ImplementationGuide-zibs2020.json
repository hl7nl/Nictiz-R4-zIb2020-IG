In the case of small children, it is often a question of fixing hands, for example, to prevent a stomach tube from being pulled out.\r\nFor nurses to use it in hospitals, Dutch Nurses Association (V&VN) published a guideline [ref. 3].\r\nIn mental health care, care for the disabled and psychogeriatric care, it always concerns care that is used against the will of the patient.\r\nThe legal framework for using these interventions is (per 1-1-2020) governed by two laws, namely:\r\n\r\n* The Wet verplichte ggz (Wvggz: Mandatory Care In Mental Health Act) for people with psychiatric disorders\r\n* The Wet zorg en dwang (Wzd: Care and Compulsion Act) for people with intellectual disabilities and people with a psychogeriatric disorder, such as dementia.\r\n\r\nThe Wvggz refers to the term compulsory care, while the Wzd uses the term involuntary care.\r\nA national registration system, the Argus registration, is used to register the interventions in the context of the Wvggz."
