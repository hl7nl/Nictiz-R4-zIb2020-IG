Please note that, although the zib concepts TelecomType and NumberType are functionally equivalent to the FHIR concepts `ContactPoint.system` and `ContactPoint.use` respectively, a mismatch occurs on the concept of mobile phone numbers; the zib uses the first concept and FHIR the second. For this reason, the ValueSet on `ContactPoint.system` is too narrow and the zib code will need to be communicated using the ext-CodeSpecification extension.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"ContactPoint",0,*,"ele-1
