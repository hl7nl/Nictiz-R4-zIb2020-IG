These statuses are represented using both the FHIR elements `AllergyIntolerance.clinicalStatus` and `AllergyIntolerance.verificationStatus`; most of the zib codes map to a `.clinicalStatus` code, but the zib code _nullified_ can only be represented by `.verificationStatus` = _entered-in-error_.\r\n\r\nFor both these FHIR elements, a separate ConceptMap is defined. Although both ConceptMaps include _unmatched_ concepts, together they provide an _equal_ mapping of each AllergieStatusCodelijst concept. Therefore, there's no need to include the zib code using the ext-CodeSpecification extension, as would normally be expected in these situations.",

Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be immune-mediated are, in fact, non-immune, but in some cases can still pose a life threatening risk. It is acknowledged that many clinicians might not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term \"allergy\" is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of \"intolerance\" - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts might not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance. If, as is commonly the case, it is unclear whether the reaction is due to an allergy or an intolerance, then the type element should be omitted from the resource.",

It can be based on the severity of past reactions, the dose and manner of exposure which caused reactions in the past, and the life-threatening potential of the type of reaction. Critical extent is a property of the allergy, and not of the reaction itself.",
      "comment" : "The default criticality value for any propensity to an adverse reaction should be 'Low Risk', indicating at the very least a relative contraindication to deliberate or voluntary exposure to the substance. 'High Risk' is flagged if the clinician has identified a propensity for a more serious or potentially life-threatening reaction, such as anaphylaxis, and implies an absolute contraindication to deliberate or voluntary exposure to the substance. If this element is missing, the criticality is unknown (though it may be known elsewhere).  Systems that capture a severity at the condition level are actually representing the concept of criticality whereas the severity documented at the reaction level is representing the true reaction severity.  Existing systems that are capturing both condition criticality and reaction severity may use the term \"severity\" to represent both.  Criticality is the worst it could be in the future (i.e. situation-agnostic) whereas severity is situation-dependent.",
