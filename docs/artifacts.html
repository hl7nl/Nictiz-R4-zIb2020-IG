Disorders that describe the body’s sensitivity to a substance which results in a specific physiological reaction after being exposed to that substance are referred to as allergies. These are described in a separate information model.
Warnings for non-allergic disorders can concern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A disorder, condition or diagnosis which can be considered as a contraindication for undergoing a certain type of therapy, such as pregnancy or long QT syndrome;</li>
  <li>Impaired functioning of an organ system (heart failure, impaired liver or kidney function, weakened immune system);</li>

<p>Freedom restricting interventions are interventions that are used against the will of the person concerned and that consciously restrict the person’s freedom to protect the person or his environment. This definition includes many forms of freedom restriction, such as (not exhaustive)
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Forced administration of fluid and nutrition</li>
  <li>Forced administration of medication</li>
  <li>Performing medical checks or other medical procedures</li>
  <li>Restricting freedom of movement</li>
  <li>Admitting to an accommodation and secluding when admitted to an accommodation.</li>
  <li>Exercising supervision</li>
  <li>Searching of clothing or body</li>
  <li>Restriction of visitors and the use of communication means

In the hospital, it is usually about restricting the freedom of movement, for example by using bed rails, moving a chair near to the table or using an arm splint for infusion. In combination with freedom-restricting interventions, soothing medication can be administered. In the case of small children, it is often a question of fixing hands, for example, to prevent a stomach tube from being pulled out.
For nurses to use it in hospitals, Dutch Nurses Association (V&amp;VN) published a guideline [ref. 3].
In mental health care, care for the disabled and psychogeriatric care, it always concerns care that is used against the will of the patient.
The legal framework for using these interventions is (per 1-1-2020) governed by two laws, namely:
</li>
  <li>The Wet verplichte ggz (Wvggz: Mandatory Care In Mental Health Act) for people with psychiatric disorders</li>
  <li>The Wet zorg en dwang (Wzd: Care and Compulsion Act) for people with intellectual disabilities and people with a psychogeriatric disorder, such as dementia.

The Wvggz refers to the term compulsory care, while the Wzd uses the term involuntary care.
A national registration system, the Argus registration, is used to register the interventions in the context of the Wvggz.</li>

VAS (Visual Analogue Score), in which the patient points to a bar with a line to indicate the pain they feel. The back of the bar has a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain) on it.

A type of medication can be indicated with <strong>a single code</strong>. That code can be chosen from several possible coding systems (concretely: GPK, PRK, HPK or article numbers). Correct use of these codes in the software systems will sufficiently record the composition of the product used, making a complete product specification unnecessary.

In addition to a primary code, <strong>alternative codes</strong> from other coding systems can also be entered (so that the GPK can be sent along in the event that the patient was registered based on PRK, for example).

Entering multiple ingredients will enable you to display a compound product. If one of the composite parts is liquid, the dosage will be given in milliliters; otherwise it will be given in ‘units’.

In that case, the <strong>composition of the medication</strong> can be specified implicitly (with the use of a medication code) or explicitly, for example by listing the (active) ingredient(s) of the medication.

<strong>Magistral prescriptions</strong> can be entered as well. This can be done by means of the option listed above to enter coded ingredients and/or by entering the composition and preparation method as free text.

This situation can be described by the person involved (the patient) themselves (in the form of a complaint), or by their healthcare provider (in the form of a diagnosis, for example). The situation can form cause for diagnostic or therapeutic policy.

A problem includes all kinds of medical or nursing information that represents a health problem. A problem can represent various types of health problems:
 
A complaint, finding by patient: a subjective, negatively experienced observation of the patient’s health. Examples: stomach ache, amnesia

A symptom: an observation by or about the patient which may indicate a certain disease. Examples: fever, blood in stool, white spots on the roof of the mouth;

A diagnosis: medical interpretation of complaints and findings. Examples: Diabetes Mellitus type II, pneumonia, hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

A functional limitation: a reduction of functional options. Examples: reduced mobility, help required for dressing.

A complication: Every diagnosis seen by the healthcare provider as an unforeseen and undesired result of medical action. Examples: post-operative wound infections, loss of hearing through the use of antibiotics.</p>

<p>Freedom restricting interventions are interventions that are used against the will of the person concerned and that consciously restrict the person’s freedom to protect the person or his environment. This definition includes many forms of freedom restriction, such as (not exhaustive)
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Forced administration of fluid and nutrition</li>
  <li>Forced administration of medication</li>
  <li>Performing medical checks or other medical procedures</li>
  <li>Restricting freedom of movement</li>
  <li>Admitting to an accommodation and secluding when admitted to an accommodation.</li>
  <li>Exercising supervision</li>
  <li>Searching of clothing or body</li>
  <li>Restriction of visitors and the use of communication means

In the hospital, it is usually about restricting the freedom of movement, for example by using bed rails, moving a chair near to the table or using an arm splint for infusion. In combination with freedom-restricting interventions, soothing medication can be administered. In the case of small children, it is often a question of fixing hands, for example, to prevent a stomach tube from being pulled out.
For nurses to use it in hospitals, Dutch Nurses Association (V&amp;VN) published a guideline [ref. 3].
In mental health care, care for the disabled and psychogeriatric care, it always concerns care that is used against the will of the patient.
The legal framework for using these interventions is (per 1-1-2020) governed by two laws, namely:
</li>
  <li>The Wet verplichte ggz (Wvggz: Mandatory Care In Mental Health Act) for people with psychiatric disorders</li>
  <li>The Wet zorg en dwang (Wzd: Care and Compulsion Act) for people with intellectual disabilities and people with a psychogeriatric disorder, such as dementia.

The Wvggz refers to the term compulsory care, while the Wzd uses the term involuntary care.
A national registration system, the Argus registration, is used to register the interventions in the context of the Wvggz.</li>

<p>Arterial oxygen saturation, also referred to as saturation, is an indicator for the amount of oxygen bound to the hemoglobin in the red blood cells of the arteries. The measurement is usually carried out as a transcutaneous measurement with a blood oxygen monitor or pulse oximeter. The saturation level is expressed as a percentage and should be over 95% in healthy people.</p>

<p>The pain score is a general measurement for pain experience, not a description of specific, localized pain.

The following are used as an easily reproducible measurement for pain experience:
NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) in which the patient gives the pain a number on a scale of 1 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain).
VAS (Visual Analogue Score), in which the patient points to a bar with a line to indicate the pain they feel. The back of the bar has a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain) on it.

The results of both scores have the same meaning, but the visual analogue method (VAS) is seen as more reliable than the NRS pain score.</p>

A type of medication can be indicated with <strong>a single code</strong>. That code can be chosen from several possible coding systems (concretely: GPK, PRK, HPK or article numbers). Correct use of these codes in the software systems will sufficiently record the composition of the product used, making a complete product specification unnecessary.

In addition to a primary code, <strong>alternative codes</strong> from other coding systems can also be entered (so that the GPK can be sent along in the event that the patient was registered based on PRK, for example).

Entering multiple ingredients will enable you to display a compound product. If one of the composite parts is liquid, the dosage will be given in milliliters; otherwise it will be given in ‘units’.

In that case, the <strong>composition of the medication</strong> can be specified implicitly (with the use of a medication code) or explicitly, for example by listing the (active) ingredient(s) of the medication.

<strong>Magistral prescriptions</strong> can be entered as well. This can be done by means of the option listed above to enter coded ingredients and/or by entering the composition and preparation method as free text.

The situation can form cause for diagnostic or therapeutic policy.

A problem includes all kinds of medical or nursing information that represents a health problem. A problem can represent various types of health problems:
 
A complaint, finding by patient: a subjective, negatively experienced observation of the patient’s health. Examples: stomach ache, amnesia

A symptom: an observation by or about the patient which may indicate a certain disease. Examples: fever, blood in stool, white spots on the roof of the mouth;

A diagnosis: medical interpretation of complaints and findings. Examples: Diabetes Mellitus type II, pneumonia, hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

A functional limitation: a reduction of functional options. Examples: reduced mobility, help required for dressing.

A complication: Every diagnosis seen by the healthcare provider as an unforeseen and undesired result of medical action. Examples: post-operative wound infections, loss of hearing through the use of antibiotics.</p>

<p>Immunization can be defined as “Generating natural immunity against pathogens by means of vaccination (active immunization) or by administering immunoglobulins (passive immunization)”.

Only the (administered and planned) vaccinations are included in this information model. Administering immunoglobulins is part of the medication overview. Vaccinations have lifelong relevance.

Most vaccinations are carried out in the Netherlands as part of the RVP (Rijksvaccinatieprogramma, National Immunisation Program). RVP information is especially important for children.

Vaccinations are also relevant for adult patients such as transplant patients, dialysis patients and patients with a post-splenectomy status. In addition, there are specific indications for the vaccination of risk groups, such as travelers, professionals who come into contact with blood or patients with wounds, weakened immune systems or heightened risk.</p>
